# Electronics and Code: Hello Arduino!

[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) is an ecosystem of simple, open-source hardware and software components that makes creating interactive [physical computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_computing) projects easy.
Learning about electronics and code is much more fun when you can make lights blink, buzzers buzz, and things move!

During this part of the workshop we will build a basic electronic circuit and program an Arduino micro controller. 
This is an introduction for beginners from all backgrounds, no experience with electronics or coding required!

# Project steps:

0. Introducing [Arduino Uno]({{ 'project/0-uno.html' | relative_url }})
1. Make it [Blink]({{ 'project/1-code.html' | relative_url }})!
2. Make it [Buzz]({{ 'project/2-buzz.html' | relative_url }})!

# More Information

[The MILL](http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/mill) provides everything you need for this Arduino project.

For reference, these are the materials used:

- Arduino [UNO](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3) and usb cable.
- a few basic electronic components, as found in most Arduino [starter kits](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-starter-kit): a breadboard, some jumper wires, a piezo, a 10k ohm resistor, and a photoresistor.
- [Arduino Software IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) installed on your computer. Arduino IDE is a [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and open-source software. Detailed installation instructions are available for [Linux](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux), [Windows](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows), and [Mac](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MacOSX). Alternatively, sign up for an online IDE service such as [Arduino Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor).
