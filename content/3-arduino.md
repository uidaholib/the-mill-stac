title: Microcontrollers, Code, and Simple Circuits
---

[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) is an ecosystem of simple, open-source hardware and software components that makes creating interactive [physical computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_computing) projects easy.
Learning about electronics and code is much more fun when you can make lights blink, buzzers buzz, and things move!

During this part of the workshop we will build a basic electronic circuit and program an Arduino micro controller. 
This is an introduction for beginners from all backgrounds, no experience with electronics or coding required!

## More Information

[The MILL](http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/mill) provides everything you need for this Arduino project.

Most of this workshop is based on projects from the official [Arduino starter kit](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-starter-kit-multi-language?selectedStore=us).
This means the code examples are built into the IDE and the parts are readily available.

{% capture prep %}
**Parts used in this workshop you will need:**

- An Arduino UNO and it's USB cable.
- A few basic electronic components, as found in most Arduino starter kits: a breadboard, some jumper wires, a piezo, a 10k ohm resistor, a few 220 or 330 ohm resistors, a photoresistor, and a few LEDs.
- Access to [Arduino IDE Software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), either installed on your computer or via the online Web Editor.
