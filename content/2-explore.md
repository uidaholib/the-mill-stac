title: Explore the MILL
---

We have several short activities to share some of the technology in the MILL:

## Button Maker

Makerspaces aren't all about digital tools--the MILL features many outlets for your creativity.
Our button maker is one of our most popular devices. 
Pair it with a type writer to create your custom bling!

## Vinyl Cutter

Our [Silhouette Cameo](http://www.silhouetteamerica.com/shop/machines/cameo) uses a small blade to cut paper, card stock, vinyl, fabric and more following a design you create on the computer. 
The software allows you to convert images or sketches into decals!

## Ozobots 

[Ozobots](https://ozobot.com/) are tiny programable robots--that you can command by drawing lines with a marker. 
Ours prefer to wear [Vandal Helmets](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2358903)...

## Coloring

Yes, everyone from toddler to elderly loves a good coloring session sometimes. 
We always keep a selection of art supplies and coloring book pages in the MILL--very handy for finals week stress relief!
Be sure to download our UI [Gem of the Mountains coloring books](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/gem/coloring/).

## MakeyMakey 

[MakeyMakey](http://www.makeymakey.com/) is a simple gadget that turns anything into a touchpad!
Connect the allegator clips to the MakeyMakey board and an object, then hold the ground wire. 
Touch the object to create a connection.
The MakeyMakey acts like a keyboard or mouse for any program on your computer--get creative to come up with some wacky interfaces!

Here are some web apps to play with:

- Make music with [MK-1](https://ericrosenbaum.github.io/MK-1/), a [Scratch piano](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/132053565/) (you can remix it!), [MakeyMakey piano](https://apps.makeymakey.com/piano/), or [Bongos](https://apps.makeymakey.com/bongos/)
- Try to master [Scratch Tetris](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/31651654/) with your friends as the controller!
- Get silly with one button games like [Platform rush](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/89243118/), [slimey-jump](https://carlospedroso.itch.io/slimey-jump), [treasure-hunter](https://jmarques.itch.io/treasure-hunter), [space-line](https://squarefox.itch.io/spaceline)

## Raspberry Pi 

[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a single board computer that is cheap, hackable, and fun! 
This simple computer runs [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), a Linux-based operating system that can do everything it's bigger laptop cousins can do. 
It comes pre-loaded with great software, like a special edition of [Minecraft](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi),  the [Scratch](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/scratch/README.md) visual programming language, or [Python Games](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/python-games/README.md) ready for you to hack.
RPI is great for learning to code, building projects, or just playing some games!

## VR / AR

Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are emerging tech with ever increasing use cases. 
The MILL has several simple devices to start exploring the possibilities.
[Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) is a cheap way to transform your phone into a VR headset:

- start with Cardboard demo app ([android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.samples.apps.cardboarddemo), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id987962261))
- take a virtual voyage with Google Street View ([android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.street&hl=en_US), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-street-view/id904418768))
- use Cardboard Camera to create your own VR images ([android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.vr.cyclops), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cardboard-camera/id1095487294))
- check out [Chrome Experiments](https://vr.chromeexperiments.com/) which demo possibilities you could create yourself using web code!
