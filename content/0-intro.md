# Welcome!

Welcome to the [University of Idaho Library](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/)!

We are the largest library in the state of Idaho with millions of print and online books and periodicals.
Additionally, our collections include a [Regional Depository for U.S. Government Documents](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/find/govdocs/), [Special Collections & Archives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/), [International Jazz Collections](https://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/), and extensive [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/).
We have regular [workshops](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/workshops/resources.html) and fun events like [coloring books](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/gem/coloring/).
The library is a hub for active learning on campus, with great spaces for studying and collaborating. 

The Making, Innovating, and Learning Laboratory ([The MILL](http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/mill)) is a place to gather, explore, learn, and create new knowledge using state-of-the-art technology and other traditional forms of making. 
Located on the newly renovated first floor of the library and open to everyone on campus, the MILL is creative and inclusive, and we strive to facilitate the free and open exchange of ideas and knowledge between disciplines.
